# ItÂ´s Nice That Clone
Personal project to learn, test and improve my html, css & vanilla JavaScript knowledge.

I am using my Sass Boilerplate, feel free to use it is you want ;) 

Starting code for a sass static site. Contains:

- Folders and basic files organized after the ITCSS architecture principles
- An npm task runner for compile and watch (start), and for build with autoprefixer and css min. (build:css)

## Start
```
npm install
npm run start
```
## Build
```
npm install
npm run build:css
```
